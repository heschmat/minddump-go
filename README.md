## Credits & Learning Source

This project is based on my hands-on study of  
**“Let's Go: Learn to Build Professional Web Applications with Go”** by Alex Edwards.

I'm working through the book while:

- Adding my own comments and explanations  
- Expanding sections that weren't immediately clear to me  
- Experimenting with small features and modifications  
- Documenting my learning process in this repository  

Some additions include:

- Extra inline code commentary  
- README learning notes, `NOTES.md`  
- Small feature enhancements  
- Planned extensions beyond the original scope  

All credit for the original project structure, concepts, and teaching approach goes to Alex Edwards.

If you're learning Go web development, I highly recommend supporting the author by purchasing the [book](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/).

This repository exists purely for personal learning and educational purposes and is not a substitute for the original book.
